Changelog
=========

v1.1.0
------

* Avoid emitting any patently empty volume, because TRIPOLI-4 chokes on them. A
  patently empty volume is defined a volume where the same surface appears in
  both the PLUS list and the MINUS list. Such volumes may not be empty if they
  are followed by a UNION operator. Since TRIPOLI-4 does not like patently
  empty volumes, we replace their definition with the intersection of two
  disjoint half-spaces.

  Fixes issue #48.


v1.0.0
------

* Handle surface IDs >= 1000 as implicitly defined, if not given in the input
  file.

  Surface IDs >= 1000 have a special meaning in MCNP. They are interpreted as
  (surf_id + 1000*cell_id), where cell_id refers to a cell card and surf_id
  refers to another surface card. For example, surface ID 123456 refers to cell
  123 and surface 456. The meaning of this syntax is that surface 123456 is
  obtained by applying the transformation defined in the TRCL card of cell 123
  to surface 456.
* Print the real MCNP cell number in the T4 comments whenever possible.

v0.6.0
------

* Python 3.8 required.
* Implement torus rotations (fixes `issue #34
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/34>`_).
* Fix adjustment of imprecise rotation matrices.

v0.5.0
------

* Python 3.6 required.
* Add caching for cell definitions. This reduces the redundance of the
  generated TRIPOLI-4 output files and usually results in faster conversion and
  faster TRIPOLI-4 execution.
* Add CLI options to control cell inlining.
* Fix conversion of isotopes starting with a zero.
* Handle complement of lattice base cells.
* Fix the conversion of cells with TRCL and FILL.
* Move to poetry for package creation.

v0.4.0
------

* Implement conversion of ``SQ`` surfaces (fixes `issue #11
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/11>`_)
* Improve error reporting (works towards fixing `issue #23
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/23>`_, although I doubt
  this issue can ever be closed).
* Correctly support MCNP input files containing tabs.
* Support rotation matrices in short form (3 parameters, 5 parameters, 6
  parameters).
* Largely reduce the memory footprint of the conversion process; this is
  crucial for largish (a few GB) output files.
* Add a flag (``--skip-deduplication``) to skip surface deduplication.
* Support references to macrobody facets in cell definitions.
* Fix a few bugs.

v0.3.0
------

* Implement conversion of the ``LIKE n BUT`` syntax (fixes `issue #26
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/26>`_)
* Implement conversion of hexagonal lattices (``LAT=2``, fixes `issue #22
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/22>`_)
* Implement conversion of macrobodies (fixes `issue #25
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/25>`_)
* Add a command-line option (-e) to specify the encoding of the input file
  (fixes `issue #27 <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/27>`_)
* Handle the MCNP data card shortcuts (``14R``, ``J``, ``I``, etc., fixes
  `issue #24 <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/24>`_)
* Support importance keywords for multiple particles
* Support "message:" MCNP cards
* Support affine transformations with 13 parameters
* Improve error message on TatSu parse errors (partially fixes `issue #23
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/23>`_)
* Add integration tests with MCNP and Oracle (fixes `issue #6
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/6>`_)
* Add documentation for the Oracle tooling
* Add a message with the list of the cells that were skipped during the
  conversion
* Bug fixes:

  * Fix parsing of consecutive complement operators (``#1#2``, fixes `issue #33
    <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/33>`_)
  * Fix handling of TRCL keyword on cells defined using the complement operator
    (fixes `issue #32 <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/32>`_)
  * Fix several issues with line continuations (fixes `issue #29
    <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/29>`_)
  * Fix parsing of input files without a newline at the end (fixes `issue #28
    <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/28>`_)
  * Fix conversion of material cards containing keywords (ntab, ptab, etc.)

* Lots of refactoring and cleaning

v0.2.0
------

* Support conversion of planes defined by three points (fixes `issue #1
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/1>`_).
* Add support for 0 as a cone sheet specifier (fixes `issue #2
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/2>`_).
* Add support for elliptic tori in MIP (fixes `issue #3
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/3>`_).
* Handle the specification of ``FILL`` transformations by ID (fixes `issue #4
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/4>`_).
* Partially handle conversion of lattices in fully-specified form (fixes `issue
  #16 <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/16>`_).
* Fix parsing of cell card options starting with ``*FILL`` in MIP.
* Fix detection of line continuation.
* Preserve the precision of isotope concentrations in the MCNP file.
* Make pytest runnable from the package root directory.
* Fix conversion of materials specified by density and atomic fractions (fixes
  `issue #8 <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/8>`_).
* Fix conversion of materials specified by total atomic concentration and
  atomic fractions (fixes `issue #14
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/14>`_).
* Support spaces between the # operator and its arguments (fixes `issue #10
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/10>`_).
* Handle the conversion of cards with a TRCL keyword (fixes `issue #21
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/21>`_).
* Remove duplicated surfaces (fixes `issue #19
  <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/19>`_).
* Do not use fixed IDs for the helper surface used in UNION cells (fixes `issue
  #15 <https://github.com/arekfu/t4_geom_convert/issues/15>`_).
* Do not emit TRIPOLI-4 cells where the same surface appears twice.
* Some linting and refactoring.
